# Lilu-VBA
Assign letter group is a macro that consists of 5 private sub-routines within the main public subroutine.
		
1. ManufacturerCount()
2. DownloadedDate()
3. CountPerDate()
4. GetLetter()	
5. LetterGroupAssign()		
		
The user only runs Assign_Letter_Groups which triggers all sub-macros to run. 	


There are two versions: 
No Loop
Loop

So I made two version one is with loop function which is little bit slower, and the other one is no loop functions which is much faster.
